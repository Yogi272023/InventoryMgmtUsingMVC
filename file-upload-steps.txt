// To work with files(now for our app user is writing url but 
we want that they can upload file from the system whose url will be stored in model 
and it will come from server through collector.)

1. Install multer (to work with files with express we will use 3rd party package).
2. Changes in view (for now in view it is type of text but we want it to be type file).
3. Middleware to handle files.
4. Apply the middleware.
5. Update Controller to update urls of images.
